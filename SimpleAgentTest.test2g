timeout=300. % 5 minutes; shorten this for quicker testing of earlier stars

% This test performs checks to see if a star is (likely) obtained by the agent team.
% A failure of a specific condition indicates which star you failed to achieve; 
% if a condition is not listed in the test results as failed, you passed that specific criteria.
% Be aware: this is not fully incremental, nor does it check percept handling and things like comments or hardcoding.
